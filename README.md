# PowerBI-Project-Sales-Data-Analysis-and-Modelling
#Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights that drive business decisions. Using Power BI, the project transforms raw sales data into interactive dashboards and reports, enabling stakeholders to monitor performance, identify opportunities, and optimize strategies.
# Key Features
# 1. Data Modeling
Created a star schema with fact and dimension tables (e.g., Sales, Products, Customers, Dates).

Established relationships between tables to ensure accurate and efficient analysis.

Used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures (e.g., YTD Sales, Profit Margins).

# 2. Interactive Dashboards
Sales Overview Dashboard:

Total Revenue, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value (AOV).

Trend analysis with time-series charts (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Product Performance Dashboard:

 Top-selling products and categories by revenue/profit.
 
 Product-level insights (e.g., regional sales, seasonality).

Customer Insights Dashboard:

Customer segmentation (new vs. returning, high-value customers).

Geographic analysis (sales by region, country, or city).
